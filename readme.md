### Web3 Bug Bounty Collection

## Introduction

Welcome to the Web3 Bug Bounty Collection repository! This project aims to curate a comprehensive list of independently hosted bug bounty programs within the Web3 ecosystem that offer substantial rewards, with payouts ranging into six figures. As the Web3 space continues to grow, security becomes paramount, and these bug bounty programs play a crucial role in identifying and mitigating potential vulnerabilities.

## What is Web3?

Web3 refers to the next evolution of the internet, where decentralization and blockchain technologies are integrated to create a more user-centric and trustless online experience. This includes decentralized applications (dApps), blockchain networks, smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, and more.

## Why Bug Bounties?

Bug bounties are initiatives set up by projects and organizations to incentivize ethical hackers and security researchers to find and report potential security vulnerabilities within their systems. By rewarding these researchers for responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities, projects can proactively improve their security posture and protect their users' assets and data.
